                    <h4>Stay Awake Tutoring and Coaching</h4>
                    <p>My short-term goal is to bring the awakening that I experience to the mid-Michigan area. I recognize that I am not a teacher in any of the traditions that I am involved in but I believe that I can tutor others in meditation or point out effective teachers to help start that journey. Please contact me if you are interested.  My long term goal is to become a Priest in Mondo Zen so that I can bring these traditions fully to the state that I love. I hope you will join me in the creation of a new community. In short, this is my best attempt of being in service to others at this point in my process.</p>
